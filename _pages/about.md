This is a comprehensive snapshot of my life and it is inspired by [Alex Vermeer](https://alexvermeer.com/life-hacking/).

My life is about <a href="#live">living</a>, <a href="#love">loving</a> and <a href="#labour">labouring</a> meaningfully. It is guided by my values of independence, resilience and reverence. Independence means discovering the things meaningful to me and practicing my way of life. Resilience means taking actions consistently and persevering through challenges. Reverence means dedicating to a grand vision that betters the interests of others.
